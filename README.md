# Space-Invader
Basic version of Space Invaders game

Gameplay:<br>
Spacehip: Game is played with three keys "left arrow key", "right arrow key", and "spacebar". Right and left arrow keys are used to move our spaceship right and left, space is used for shooting our bullets.<br><br>
Ghosts: Ghosts travel from left to right or right to left, also after an impact with the wall they change directions and come closer to our spaceship. However if a ghost is impacted by the bullet, it spawns from a random start position (top of the screen).<br><br>
Bullet Mechanism: Bullet is ready to use for our spaceship if the bullet is not visible on the screen, this can happen in two ways after the shooting, if the bullet impacts a ghost or after the bullet travels all the way to the top.<br><br>
Ending: If a ghost comes close to the bottom side of the screen.
